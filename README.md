# Roller Coaster Analysis Repository

Welcome to Felicia Patel & Hallie Christophersonâ€™s Roller Coaster Analysis Repository. Below you will find descriptions of each of the files.

## Files Description:

1. **AnalyzeRank.py**
   - Follows tutorial for testing algorithms from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)
   - Uses `clean_total.csv`
   - Generates boxplots from different algorithms
   - Confusion matrix output highlights issues with using an unbalanced dataset

2. **Cleaning.py**
   - Cleans `data.csv` files, dropping unused columns and ones that were mainly null
   - Drops all instances of null from the columns we want to use in our analysis
   - Runs testing algorithms to see the results for each algorithm
   - Realizes data was unbalanced

3. **Col_visuals_ranked.py**
   - Makes histograms for features when data is unranked and when features are ranked

4. **Col_visuals.py**
   - Makes visuals to analyze based on the entire dataset being used
   - Creates boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots

5. **Combine_tables.py**
   - Combines rank and `data.csv` set to make one `total_ranks` dataset

6. **Correlation.py**
   - Creates a correlation matrix to analyze the realtionships between the factors we are studying

7. **Displaytree.py**
   - Generates the decision tree display

8. **mixSampling.py**
   - Applies both oversampling and undersampling on the dataset
   - Visualizes confusion matrix with a heatmap

9. **Oversampling.py**
   - Oversamples the dataset
   - Visualizes confusion matrix with a heatmap

9. **Undersampling.py**
   - Undersamples the dataset
   - Visualizes confusion matrix with a heatmap
